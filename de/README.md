# Personal Website

Theme based on the theme [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio) for [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), hosted with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), and redirected to [chriskrauter.de](http://www.chriskrauter.de).

Meant to be simple, still WIP.

## License

The theme is available as open source under the terms of the [MIT License](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio/blob/master/LICENSE).

Originally, **al-folio** was based on the [\*folio theme](https://github.com/bogoli/-folio) (published by [Lia Bogoev](https://liabogoev.com) and under the MIT license).
Since then, it got a full re-write of the styles and many additional cool features.
