My research interest lies in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) with a focus on novel mobile devices. I am further interested in Augmented and Virtual Reality (AR/VR) and information visualization. I completed my Bachelor's degree in media informatics, followed by a Master's degree in computer science, both at the University of Stuttgart. Currently, I am pursuing my Ph.D. at the same university. My previous work covered notification placement in VR (bachelor thesis), an immersive social distancing VR demo, and a smart chair for sitting posture recognition and feedback (master thesis).
