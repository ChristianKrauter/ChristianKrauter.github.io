My research interests cover Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), information visualization, and Augmented and Virtual Reality (AR/VR), and I plan to combine these areas during my Ph.D. studies. I completed my Bachelor's degree in media informatics, followed by a Master's degree in computer science, both at the University of Stuttgart. Currently, I am pursuing my Ph.D. at the same university. My previous work covered notification placement in VR (bachelor thesis), an immersive social distancing VR demo, and a smart chair for sitting posture recognition and feedback (master thesis).

I look forward to hearing from you.
