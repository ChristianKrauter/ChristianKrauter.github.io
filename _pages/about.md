My research interests cover Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), information visualization, and Augmented and Virtual Reality (AR/VR), which I aim to combine during my PhD studies. I acquired my Bachelor's in media informatics and my Master's in computer science at the University of Stuttgart, where I am now also pursuing my Ph.D. My previous work covered notification placement in VR (bachelor thesis), an immersive social distancing VR demo, and a smart chair for sitting posture recognition and feedback (master thesis).
